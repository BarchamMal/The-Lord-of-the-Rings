There are a lot, I mean _a lot_ of features, items, and blocks to add here.
The ones listed here are only a few, and I'll have to read the Silmarilion, The Lord of The Rings, and The Hobbit, and write down all of them, but this will do for now.

> [!NOTE]
> This is mostly artist work, though all of it will need coded, the bulk of it is textures and models.
